# pandas-challenge
For this challenge I mainly relied on the starter code provided, class notes, and googling with questions. However, I also found the Ask the Class Slack channel to be very helpful. In particular, at one point I was stuck on an array error and Aaron Otto pointed me in the right direction. Ryan Freeman was also very helpful. I originally used .loc to create 15 different DFs for each school and did my calculations that way for the per_school_summary. However, after chatting with Ryan I decided to try the same thing using groupby (his suggestion) and it was much quicker. For most of my googling I found help on stack overflow.
